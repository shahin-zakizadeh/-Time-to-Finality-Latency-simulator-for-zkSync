# Time to Finality Latency simulator for zkSync
Overview
This project is a Time to Finality (Latency) simulator for zkSync, developed using Python and the web3 library. It aims to simulate and measure the latency involved in reaching finality on the zkSync Layer 2 protocol. zkSync is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, designed to increase throughput and reduce gas fees while maintaining the security and decentralization of the Ethereum mainnet.

Features
Simulation of Transaction Latency: Simulates the time taken for transactions to achieve finality on zkSync.
Web3 Integration: Utilizes the web3 library to interact with the zkSync network and retrieve real-time data.
Customizable Parameters: Allows users to customize simulation parameters such as transaction volume, network congestion, and gas fees.
Data Visualization: Provides visual representations of latency data to help users understand the performance of zkSync under various conditions.
Comprehensive Documentation: Includes detailed documentation to guide users on how to set up and use the simulator effectively.
